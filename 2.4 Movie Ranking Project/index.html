<h3>25th Hour</h3>
<P>Tomorrow morning, Monty Brogan is turning  
    himself in to begin a prison term. His two 
    best friends lean on a railing , look out over
     the river, and agree “it’s over.” They will never
      see Monty again. He may be alive in eight years,
       but he won’t be the Monty they’ve known since 
       they were kids. Monty Brogan also knows this. 
       So do his girlfriend and his father. It will all
        end after tonight.</P>
<h3>Monsieur Hire</h3>
<p>Patrice Leconte‘s “Monsieur Hire” is
     a tragedy about loneliness and 
     erotomania, told about two solitary
      people who have nothing else in
       common. It involves a murder, and
        the opening shot is of a corpse.
         Monsieur Hire is a scrawny,
          balding middle-aged tailor 
          who lives by himself. Alice is
           a beautiful, tender-hearted 
           22-year-old blonde who lives
            alone across the courtyard 
            from Hire in the same apartment
             building</p>
